                    At Woven by Toyota, I took on a tech instructor role where I
                    had the rewarding opportunity to teach Python programming to
                    Toyota employees from diverse technical backgrounds. This
                    initiative was part of Woven&apos;s broader mission to
                    empower its workforce with cutting-edge software skills in
                    support of mobility innovation.
                </P>
                <P>
                    I delivered a structured curriculum tailored for beginners
                    and intermediate learners, covering core programming
                    concepts such as data types, control structures, functions,
                    object-oriented programming, and API integration. The
                    emphasis was not just on writing code but on developing
                    problem-solving skills, clean coding habits, and the ability
                    to think computationally.
                </P>
                <P>
                    To enhance learning outcomes, I led live interactive coding
                    exercises and hands-on projects, making sure to incorporate
                    real-world examples, ensuring participants could immediately
                    apply what they learned. I also led group discussions and
                    review sessions to reinforce key concepts and foster
                    collaborative learning.
                </P>
                <P>
                    One of the highlights of this role was witnessing
                    participants gain the confidence to build functional tools
                    and scripts that could support their own teams&apos;
                    workflows. By demystifying Python and lowering the barrier
                    to entry, I helped foster a culture of self-driven learning
                    and cross-functional collaboration.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Teaching at Woven by Toyota deepened my understanding of how
                    to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and
                    empathetically. It also reaffirmed my belief that software
                    literacy is a foundational skill in today&apos;s worldâ€”one
                    that can empower individuals across disciplines to innovate
                    and build.
                </P>
